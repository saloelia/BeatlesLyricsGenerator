# BeatlesLyricsGenerator
In this notebook, I used RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs for generating Beatles-style lyrics. I have trained the models using 2 approaches: Char prediction and Word prediction, and search for ideal hyperparameters for each model. A small EDA is also featured. The work was done with the Keras framework.
If you have any comments, spot some mistakes or have suggestions for improving the models, feel free to send me a message.
