# BeatlesLyricsGenerator
In this notebook, I used RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs for generating Beatles-style lyrics. I have trained the models using 2 approaches: Char prediction and Word prediction, and search for ideal hyperparameters for each model. A small EDA is also featured. The work was done with the Keras framework.
